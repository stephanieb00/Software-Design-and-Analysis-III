Software Design and Analysis III
Respository filled with projects done for a course taken where I grew my C++ skillset. 

The course's principal objective is to expand on topics in the design and analysis of algorithms and data structures. This includes the introduction of hashes, heaps, various forms of trees, and graphs. It also revisits recursion and the sorting problem from a higher perspective than was presented in the prequels. On top of this, it is intended to introduce methods of algorithmic analysis. Another objective of the course is to give the students the chance to develop their software development skills a little more, and to give them practical experience for more productive programming.
